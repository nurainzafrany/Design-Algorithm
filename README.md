# Design-Algorithm

Problem statement:

The challenge is to design an efficient delivery system using drones to transport emergency supplies to flood-affected towns with physical access cut off. The goal is to optimize delivery plans considering drone limitations and town urgency.

Objectives:

-Model the affected region as a graph.

-Analyze various algorithm paradigms for route optimization.

-Develop an efficient Java-based solution.

-Prove the algorithm's correctness and analyze its performance.

Expected output:

Java program that outputs optimized delivery routes and visualization or textual output of town coverage, time, and energy use.

Problem scenario description:

A severe flood has hit a region in Southeast Asia, damaging infrastructure and cutting off several rural towns. Emergency supplies need to be delivered using drones, but drones have limited capacity and battery life. The goal is to determine the optimal set of delivery routes to maximize coverage while minimizing energy usage.

Why it is important?

-Helps in quick and efficient emergency response.

-Optimizes limited resources (drones, fuel, time).

-Supports critical decision-making to save lives.
